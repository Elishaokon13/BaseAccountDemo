I want to build a Mini e-Commerce Checkout (Recommended)

What it is: A tiny React/Next.js storefront with a single product.

Features you can demo:

Sign in with Base: Authenticate before purchase.

Base Pay: One-tap USDC checkout.

Sub Accounts: Create a sub account for “Orders” to auto-spend.

Spend Permissions: Pre-approve a $20 daily limit.

Why it works: Visually clear—people instantly “get” payments and limits. You can screen record each step.
