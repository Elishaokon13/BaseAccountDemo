# Base Account SDK E-commerce Demo Planning

## Background and Motivation
This project aims to create a minimal but fully functional e-commerce checkout demo using Base Account SDK, showcasing key features like Sign in with Base, Base Pay, Sub Accounts, and Spend Permissions. The demo needs to be concise enough for a 3-minute video walkthrough while demonstrating real Web3 functionality on Base testnet.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Integration Complexity
   - Need to properly sequence SDK initialization, auth, sub-account creation, and payment flow
   - Must handle proper state management for user session and transaction status
   - Need to ensure proper error handling and user feedback

2. Technical Requirements
   - Using Next.js pages router (not app router) with TypeScript
   - Implementing Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Keeping code under 200 lines while maintaining readability
   - Ensuring all Web3 interactions are real (no mocks)

3. User Experience
   - Clear feedback for each step (auth, sub-account creation, permissions, payment)
   - Simple but polished UI with proper loading states
   - Informative error messages for Web3 interactions

## High-level Task Breakdown

### 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and pages router
- [ ] Install and configure dependencies (Base Account SDK, Tailwind CSS)
- [ ] Set up basic project structure
Success Criteria: Project runs with `npm run dev` without errors

### 2. Base SDK Integration
- [ ] Initialize Base Account SDK with proper configuration
- [ ] Implement Sign in with Base functionality
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types and error handling
Success Criteria: User can successfully authenticate with Base Account

### 3. Sub Account Implementation
- [ ] Create "Orders" sub-account after sign-in
- [ ] Implement spend permissions (20 USDC/day limit)
- [ ] Add proper error handling and status feedback
Success Criteria: Sub-account is created and permissions are set correctly

### 4. Payment Flow
- [ ] Create product display component
- [ ] Implement Base Pay integration
- [ ] Add transaction status tracking
Success Criteria: Complete test purchase flows successfully on Base testnet

### 5. UI/UX Implementation
- [ ] Style product card with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Add loading states and transitions
- [ ] Implement responsive design
Success Criteria: UI is polished and responsive across devices

### 6. Documentation and Testing
- [ ] Add setup instructions in README
- [ ] Document testnet configuration steps
- [ ] Test full flow on Base testnet
Success Criteria: Another developer can follow instructions to run the demo

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
*No feedback yet - waiting to begin implementation*

## Lessons
- Base Account SDK requires proper initialization before any other operations
- Need to handle wallet connection states properly
- Important to test with actual testnet tokens and RPC endpoints

## Next Steps
Ready to begin implementation starting with Project Setup. Waiting for user confirmation to proceed with Executor mode.
